## About

Recommendation site is a site you can go to if you don't know what to watch, what to play or what to read this evening. You can see what other users recommend: what books to read, what games to play or what movies to watch. Also, you can sort by category: best, newest, books, games, etc. In case you also want to recommend something to other users, you can registrate or authorize with Microsoft or Google accounts. After authorization you can create your own recommendations and rate them, as well as comment on other recommendations
